# LMFOOLS
Need a GUI that is tailored for MLM? Look no further! You've found a universal application that supports Windows, Linux and macOS.

This software is not associated with nor created by Mathworks.

To launch the program, download the zip archive, extract its contents, and then launch "LMFOOLS".

To-do:
- Include more hand-written error messages
- Include helpful information for triad servers
- Recognize when FlexLM is running, but the server it is running on cannot have its own hostname resolved and report so
