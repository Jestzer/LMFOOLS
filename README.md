# LMFOOLS
Need a GUI that is tailored for MLM? Look no further! You've found a universal application that supports Windows, Linux and macOS.

This software is not associated with nor created by Mathworks.

Compiled builds in the release section were compiled on the following platforms:
- Windows 11
- Linux

I'll compiled macOS builds if anybody actually wants them.

To-do:
- Figure out how to get macOS and Linux lmgrd and lmutil to show up in the file picker
- Remove blank icon from update and error windows
