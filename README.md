15:17:09 (lmgrd) Starting vendor daemons ... 
15:17:09 (lmgrd) Starting vendor daemon at port 27010
15:17:09 (lmgrd) Using vendor daemon port 27010 specified in license file
15:17:24 (lmgrd) The TCP port number in the license, 27010, is already in use.
15:17:24 (lmgrd) Possible causes: 
15:17:24 (lmgrd)    1) The license server manager (lmgrd) is already running for this license.
15:17:24 (lmgrd)    2) The OS has not "cleared" this port since lmgrd died.
15:17:24 (lmgrd)    3) Another process is using this port number (unlikely).
15:17:24 (lmgrd) Solutions:
15:17:24 (lmgrd)    1) Make sure lmgrd and all vendor daemons for this 
15:17:24 (lmgrd)       license are not running.
15:17:24 (lmgrd)    2) You may have to wait for the OS to clear this port.
15:17:24 (lmgrd) Retrying for about 5 more minutes
15:17:42 (lmgrd) Still trying... 
15:18:00 (lmgrd) Still trying...
